My name is Liz and I am a huge fan of movies.  My friends and I love to get together, make some popcorn and relax into the weekend with a cinematic adventure.  Sounds perfect right?  The only problem is actually deciding on a movie we can all agree on.  I am about to take you on a movie data adventure to find which movie meets all of our preferences.  

The database I will be using contains 562 movies from the year 2007 to 2011.  It includes the movie genre and audience and critic ratings found from [Rotton Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) and the budget of each movie.

To find out a little more, I asked each of my friends what they look for in a movie.  That includes what genre they prefer or don't prefer, if they look at audience or critic ratings, or if release year is important to them.

Before we start, let's meet the crew!

Dan:  Dan loves action and adventure movies and the more explosions the better.  He thinks the bigger the budget the more action potential.  He is willing to watch comedy as long as the audience rating is higher than 60. He will watch a Drama or Romance but only if the year of release was 2011 (pretty sure he's hoping for Twilight on that one).  He will watch Horror or Thriller but only if the budget is under $20 million.  He likes the cheesy ones with a low budget best.

Based on Dan's preferences I have created a filter on SQL.
