My name is Liz and I am a huge fan of movies.  My friends and I love to get together, make some popcorn and relax into the weekend with a cinematic adventure.  Sounds perfect right?  The only problem is actually deciding on a movie we can all agree on.  I am about to take you on a movie data adventure to find which movie meets all of our preferences.  

The database I will be using contains 562 movies from the year 2007 to 2011.  It includes the movie genre and audience and critic ratings found from [Rotton Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) and the budget of each movie.

Before we start, let's meet the crew!
